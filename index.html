	<p>In 2019, the institute has signed two MoUs with NJIT, USA, for summer research and Ph.D programs at NJIT, and one
		MoU
		with IIT-Kanpur for promoting entrepreneurship and startups by sharing resources such as research facilities and
		mentors. The MoU for doctorate programs at NJIT reduces the expense of international students and brings them a
		lot
		of convenience where they can stay in their home country during the first year of their PhD studies. The MoU to
		hold
		Summer Research Programs at NJIT brings NIST students the best of right cultural environment, academic, and
		research
		exposure. It provides students with the opportunity for a global experience to enhance skills basis reciprocity
		and
		frequent interactions with NJIT mentors and students.</p>
	<br>
	<p>NIST has also signed an MoU with IIT-Kanpur to share their network resources towards building a stronger and
		vibrant
		incubation ecosystem. Both the premier institutes will explore possibilities on a case to case basis for
		co-incubation of startups by sharing mentors and extending specialized labs and product development
		infrastructure.
		NIST, in association with IIT, Kharagpur, is also part of the MHRD Virtual Laboratory project. The institute has
		signed MoUs for research collaboration in the field of nano sciences, communications, semiconductor technology
		with
		the National Taiwan University and University of Electro Communications, Japan. Also, every year a record number
		of
		NIST students are selected for master's programs and research programs in the international university, National
		Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan.</p>
